# Covid_Cases_Predictor
This Jupyter notebook aims to create a model able to give predictions for the cases of incidence in one or more contries. Compared to classical regression, this model is able to generalise data based on the virus' ability to change its transmissiblity and death rate history by feeding independently other features. This is a more realistic behaviour, as it avoids the assumption that infection and death rates are functions of time only.
