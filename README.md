# Covid_Cases_Predictor
This Jupyter notebook aims to create a model able to give predictions for the cases of incidence in one or more countries. Compared to classical regression, this model is able to generalise data based on the virus' ability to change its transmissibility and death rate history by feeding independently other features. This is a more realistic behaviour, as it avoids the assumption that infection and death rates are functions of time only. The Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and can be accessed from the link below:
